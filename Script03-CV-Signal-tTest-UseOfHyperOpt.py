Date: 28JUL2024 | Event: PyOhio 2024 | Location: Cleveland, OH
Purpose: Compare results between Script01 and Script02, to determine the impact of using HyperOpt on selecting parameters for SavGol Filter.
Expectation: Unsure... pure curiosity! Does using HyperOpt help achieve better results? If not, are differences statistically significant?
