# Signal Processing in Electrochemistry with Python: Applications to the US Opioids Crisis

## Talk Details
**Event:** PyOhio 2024  
**Date:** July 28, 2024  
**Location:** Cleveland, Ohio  
**Link:** [PyOhio 2024 Talk](https://www.pyohio.org/2024/program/talks/signal-processing-in-electrochemistry-with-python-applications/)

## Description
This repository contains the scripts and data used in my talk at PyOhio 2024. The talk (available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UPzG0HhjDE&t=2s)) demonstrates how to use Python for signal processing in electrochemistry, which could represent an opportunity to help address the US opioids crisis. The work started as an appendix of my Master's Thesis, which is available [here](http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/46030/).
